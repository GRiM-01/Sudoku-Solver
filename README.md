# Sudoku-Solver
Python Sudoku Solver that uses Deep Learning, Augmented Intelligence and Computer Vision.


PICS Methodology:

Process raw image,
Identify image patterns/features,
Classify detected digits,
Solve Sudoku puzzle.


Change the paths in the functions.py and main.py scripts to load and initialize the model and pics.

Take a screenshot or picture of the sudoku puzzle, upload it to the images folder and paste in the image name into the img_name variable.

The folders digits and DRAWN contain images that were tests from my initial Digit Recognizer project and can be used to test the accuracy of any new model you choose to load.
